# TSM-Tricks
Just collectin' all my tricks found running TSM for some time :-)

## IBM FTP Server for Downloading Clients and Server Fixes
* Clients:<br>
  https://ftp.software.ibm.com/storage/tivoli-storage-management/maintenance/client/
* Server Patches<br>
  https://ftp.software.ibm.com/storage/tivoli-storage-management/patches/server/
* OC Patches<br>
  https://ftp.software.ibm.com/storage/tivoli-storage-management/patches/opcenter/

**IMPORTANT**<br>
Server Major Releases (ending with `.0` / `-000`) must be downloaded using the customer portal as the versions on the ftp server do not include the license file!

## Blueprints & Blueprint Tools
* Overview page<br>
  https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-storage-protect-blueprints
* The `tsmdiskperf` tool is now part of the whole _Blueprint Configuration Scripts_ Collection ... and called `spdiskperf.pl`
